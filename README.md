Kinda-sorta proxy the (Cobalt UI)[http://cobalt-org.github.io/docs/usage.html]
* Use a "config.yml" for site-wide config
* "serve" command to serve the site
* add "new" to add a post - optional?

For now, skip the draft/publish feature.  Its nice to have, but not necessary for getting the site up.  I DO wnat it later, though.

You need:

* Layouts/Templates - (probably done - askama) - would be cool if we could have a set header, a set head, a set menubar, etc
* Posts - these are Markdown
* Other apps - like Mines - maybe use Docker now that you can?
* metadata?
